Program purpose:
Takes a textfile called ToSort containing only whitespaces and integers, generates it into an array, 
e.g. "3 2 1" becomes {3, 2, 1}. We then sort the array in ascending order, so {3, 2, 1}
become {1, 2, 3}. The program prints the modified array into the terminal, as well as how
many modifications or "swaps" were required to "organize" the array.

How to run:
1. Open the command line terminal.
2. Enter the project directory, e.g. "cd /home/downloads/myproject".
3. Enter "make" into the terminal to compile the program.
4. To execute the program, enter "./sss ToSort" into the terminal.

Special Cases:
If the file ToSort contains more than 200 integers, that is to say there are more than
200 integers seperated by whitespaces within the text file, the program will terminate
without generating and sorting an array. The same will occur if ToSort contains any
characters that are not integers or whitespaces.
